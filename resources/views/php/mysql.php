FROM (
SELECT 1 AS n UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4
UNION SELECT 5 UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8
) numbers
WHERE n <= LENGTH(@str) - LENGTH(REPLACE(@str, ',' , '' )) + 1; 5. Find the First Order for Each Customer SELECT o.*
    FROM orders o JOIN ( SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) AS first_order_date FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id )
    first_order ON o.customer_id=first_order.customer_id AND o.order_date=first_order.first_order_date; 6. Count of
    Orders Placed Each Day in the Last 7 Days SELECT DATE(order_date) AS day, COUNT(*) AS total_orders FROM orders WHERE
    order_date>= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
    GROUP BY day

    LEFT JOIN orders o ON o.customer_id = c.id
    GROUP BY c.id, c.name;


    9. All Employees with Sum of Presents & Leaves in Current Month

    FROM employees e
    LEFT JOIN attendance a ON a.employee_id = e.id
    AND MONTH(a.date) = MONTH(CURDATE())
    AND YEAR(a.date) = YEAR(CURDATE())
    GROUP BY e.id, e.name;
